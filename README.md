# ARM Cortex M4 based gate access control implementation

Embedded system application for user logging and gate control using a four digit 7 segment display, a rotary encoder for ID and password input, and a magnetic band card reader as an alternative for ID input.

The system features multi-language support, in-system administrative configuration for system options and ID registering, and idle sleep functionality.
